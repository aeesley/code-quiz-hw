DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this project was to setup an interactive quiz using javascript. When the user opens the application they are given the option to play a game. When they click the start game option they are provided with a set of questions and answers that they have to answer while a timer is counting down. When they are done they receive a score and are given the option to save their high score as well.

The instructions noted a quiz about javascript, but I decided to create a different game to make it more interesting.
